A Brief Report on the Titanic Shipwreck

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during his maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety standards for ships.

One reason the shipwreck caused so much loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and the crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in the survival of the shipwreck, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper class.


I conducted a brief survey of the Titanic's sinking in search of insights on the aborted topic. Then I started my exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, anomalies, I performed a Brainstorm to create relevant questions that could be answered by the dataset in question, finally, I selected the questions below:

• What is the "class" with the highest number of "survivors"?
• Which is the port of embarkation with the largest number of survivors?
• Which is the port of embarkation with the highest mortality rate?
• The highest percentage of survivors by sex?
• What is the highest mortality rate by age group?
• What rate of Mortality by age?

Description of data:

1.	Survival - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes). Not included in test.csv file.
2.	Pclass - Class of Passengers (1 = 1º, 2 = 2º, 3º = 3º)
3.	Name - First Name
4.	Sex - Sex
5.	Age-old
6.	Sibsp - Number of siblings / spouses on board
7.	Parch - Number of parents / children on board
8.	Ticket - Ticket Number
9.	Fare - passenger fare
10.	Cabin - Cabin
11.	Embarked - Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
